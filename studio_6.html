      <p>A Basin is a culture of many different types of people, however the end goal of every type of user is oriented towards
        skiing on the mountain. Eighty percent of A Basin is expert level terrain, yet all ability levels ski on the mountain.
        Arapahoe Basin is considered a home mountain to many locals who learn how to make their first turns as a kid and
        take their first chute as an expert. The existing conditions of the mountain and the base allow for all of this to
        happen, but it does not allow for a mixing of users and user experiences consistent with the different type of people
        who ski there while providing an efficient means of access to the mountain. </p>
      <p>Programs are bifurcated just like the lifts. Pallavicini, the expert level 2-pack, is far to the west on the site,
        close to The Beach, while the Black Mountain lift is on the mountain and separated from necessary amenities and programs.
        The administration area is cut off from users, and retail is near back of house. So the question is: How do we allow
        for what the multiplicity of users want, which is an efficient means of access to the mountain after they access
        what they need (skis, ski pass, or nothing). </p>
      <p> After extensive and in depth research done to identify all the different types of users on the mountain, their needs,
        and their desires, the team settled on the concept of montage as a driver for the project. The use of montage gives
        the user, no matter who they are, a multiplicity of unexpected, yet delightful and suprisingly necessary experiences
        while at Arapahoe Basin.
